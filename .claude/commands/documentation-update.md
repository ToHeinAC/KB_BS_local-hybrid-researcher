Your tsk is to update the documentation based on the latest changes.
Starting point is the last git commit. Minimally use git git status && git diff HEAD && git status --porcelain to find out.
From there, analyse the latest changes in the codebase etc.
Firstly, change the CLAUDE.md
Then go to the implementation details within the docs/ folder and make changes accordingly.
In the end, reflect all critical changes also in README.md, if necessary.
